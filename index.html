                            This study focuses on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect, a phenomenon where urban areas experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural regions due to human activities, including vehicle emissions. The objective of this research is to analyze the correlation between CO₂ emissions from vehicles and the intensification of Urban Heat Island Effect in Metro Manila. By examining this relationship, we aim to provide insights into how transportation-related emissions contribute to urban warming and its potential long-term effects on climate and public health.

                        <p>UHI intensity in Metro Manila is calculated by subtracting the weighted average of apparent maximum temperature of rural regions around Metro Manila, namely: Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite, Bataan, Pampanga, Laguna, to the apparent maximum temperature of Metro Manila.</p>

                        <p>A region is given more weight if it is closer to Metro Manila by distance and by elevation.</p>

                        <p>We can observe in this graph that the trend of UHI intensity tends to dip during midyear, which can be due to seasonal changes.

                        <p>This can affect our analysis so what we did is we grouped the UHI dataset into two seasons, the Wet and the Dry season.</p>
